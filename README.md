# inventory-tracker

Overview

Can you imagine a world without coffee? You just canâ€™t, right? Coffee shops are gathering places for coffee lovers and people from all walks of life to catch up, study, do business, and to enjoy a beverage and bite to eat. As a small coffee shop owner, there are endless pieces to keep track of in order to succeed, and one of the major parts is ensuring you have enough supply to meet the demand of your loyal customers.

With that in mind, our team decided to enhance a currently archaic supply management system from a local coffee shop. Our project consists of an inventory web app with management tools to optimize inventories, as well as inventory auditing, inventory control, and purchase order management. This inventory tracking app is designed to make small business owners' lives simpler, because tech isn't just for big, major corporations.
